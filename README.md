# COVID-diagonosis-prediction
ML based COVID prediction which predicts the corona_result through the details of age, gender, symptoms, contact history and travel history.

Two models which helped us cope with our problem - 
1. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
2. Logistic Regression

I have used Jupyter notebook and Python 3 for the above models execution
